## Important Results

We list the important results, namely the proofs of the hyper-triples, as follows. We refer to the hyper-triples in the paper by their tags. 
- Hyper-triple (2): `rlsum_rl_ntriple`
- Hyper-triple (3), (9): `rlsum_rli_ntriple`
- Hyper-triple (8): `rl_rli_ntriple`
- Hyper-triple (10): `rlsum_rl_rli_ntriple_pre`
- Hyper-triple (14): `rlsum_rl_rli_ntriple`
- Hyper-triple (18): `rl_rli_align_step`
- Hyper-triple (22): `rli_func_spec`
- Hyper-triple (24): `rlsum_rli_align_step`

We note that not all hyper-triples are mentioned above since their proofs are nested in the proofs of other hyper-triples. For example, hyper-triple (27) is proved in the proof of hyper-triple (24) with the Rule Prod.
